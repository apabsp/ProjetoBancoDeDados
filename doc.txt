Documentation on how all of this works:

First, we set up a biblioteca database.
CORS, on the backend, will allow requests from the front-end to the back-end. (src->main->java->CorsConfig)


SCRIPTS
on our resources->scripts, we can find useful scripts like the initial one to generate the Database. We don't want to, say, try to add an Obra entity and the table for it doesn't really exist yet, right?
So our main script is definitely schema.sql, that's the script that sets up all the necessary tables.

So make sure we have all of these tables, gonna verify em all now:
