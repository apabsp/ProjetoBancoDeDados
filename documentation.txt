Documentation on how all of this works:

First, we set up a biblioteca database.
CORS, on the backend, will allow requests from the front-end to the back-end. (src->main->java->CorsConfig)


SCRIPTS
on our resources->scripts folder, we can find useful scripts: schema(construct database's tables, but make sure you already have a biblioteca database on your dbeaver) and seed(add examples to the database)

-----------
So make sure we have all of these tables, gonna verify em all now:
-Autor (verified)
-Editora (verified)
-escreve (verified)
-publica (verified)
-Obra (verified and modified)
-pertence(verified)
-Genero (verified)
-Livro (verified)
-Edicao (verified and nome added)
-Artigo (verified)
-Exemplar (verified)

-Emprestimo_aluga(verified but need to verify. hora goes into data_emprestimo now as dateTime.)
-Altera(not added yet)

How the program itself works: frontend asks for the backend to act on the sql database, simple.
